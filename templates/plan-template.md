# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See
`.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement, selected approach, and
delivery-sensitive context]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the concrete
  technical details for the feature. Unknowns must be marked as
  NEEDS CLARIFICATION and resolved in research.md before implementation.
-->

**Registered Project Stack**: [Read from `.specify/context/stack.md`; if absent, state that no stack is registered yet]<br>
**Selected Approved Stack**: [Normally matches the registered stack; if not, explain the exception clearly]<br>
**Stack Fit / Justification**: [Why this feature fits the registered stack and existing product context]<br>
**Poor-Fit / Strain Signals**: [Any aspects of the feature that pull against the registered stack, and whether they require an exception]<br>
**Deviation / Exception Needed**: [None or explicit exception with rationale, scope, and approver path]<br>
**Stack Profile Constraints**: [Relevant constraints pulled from `.specify/context/stack.md`]<br>
**Stack-Specific Risks**: [Relevant risks pulled from `.specify/context/stack.md`]<br>
**Expected Stack Artifacts**: [Artifacts this feature should produce for the selected stack]<br>
**Language / Runtime**: [e.g., PHP 8.2, Node 20, MySQL 8 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [frameworks, packages, platform modules or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage / Persistence**: [existing schema, new tables, files, N/A or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Testing / QA**: [unit/integration/manual/QA flow or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Environment**: [e.g., shared hosting, Docker/Nginx/MySQL, RDS-backed environment, Moodle instance, N/A]  
**Project Type**: [portal, plugin, internal admin tool, LMS extension, web app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific targets or N/A]  
**Operational Constraints**: [latency, batch windows, legacy compatibility, uptime, export size, N/A]  
**Scale / Scope**: [users, records, institutions, reports, courses, N/A]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Stack Alignment**: Selected approach uses an approved stack or records a
  justified exception.
- **Security and Privacy**: Plan identifies whether the work touches
  authentication, authorization, sensitive data, credentials, encryption, or
  secure transport requirements.
- **Data Modeling and Integrity**: Plan states whether the work changes core
  domain data, schema, migrations, seeders, imports, exports, or persistence
  rules, and whether data-model artifacts are required.
- **Traceability and Auditability**: Plan identifies required audit trails,
  operational logs, branch strategy, and release traceability expectations.
- **Administrative Usability**: Plan states whether the work affects
  admin-facing workflows, back-office operations, large listings, reports, or
  exports, including pagination or bulk-action implications where relevant.
- **Reliability and Operations**: Plan documents operational expectations,
  deployment-sensitive components, rollback-sensitive areas, and validation of
  post-release behavior.
- **Maintainability and Standardization**: Plan identifies reusable component,
  schema, structure, or environment conventions that must be preserved.

## Impact Assessment

**Touches Authentication / Authorization**: [Yes/No + impact summary]  
**Touches Sensitive Data / Privacy**: [Yes/No + data classes and handling summary]  
**Touches Core Domain Data**: [Yes/No + entities / records affected]  
**Touches Large Listings / Reports / Exports**: [Yes/No + pagination / batching implications]  
**Touches Admin-Facing Workflows**: [Yes/No + affected operational users / flows]  
**Touches Deployment-Sensitive Components**: [Yes/No + environments / dependencies affected]  
**Touches Rollback-Sensitive Areas**: [Yes/No + why rollback is delicate]

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Implementation Considerations

### Security and Access Control

[Summarize applicable authentication, authorization, password, encryption,
secure-channel, and privacy requirements. Use "N/A" only when clearly
inapplicable.]

### Data Model and Persistence

[Summarize affected entities, schema changes, data dictionary / ER impact,
migration strategy, seeding needs, and disciplined schema handling. Use "N/A"
only when no persistence impact exists.]

### Administrative and Operational UX

[Summarize operator-facing flows, back-office actions, filters, pagination,
reporting, reusable forms, and error-recovery expectations.]

### Performance and Reliability

[Summarize operational load, large listings, export/report limits, job behavior,
timeouts, failure handling, monitoring, and recovery expectations.]

## Delivery Plan

**Branch Strategy**: [One branch per functionality, hotfix exception if needed]  
**Commit Strategy**: [Clear and frequent commits expectation for this work]  
**Promotion Path**: [feature branch -> testing -> master, or justified hotfix path]  
**QA Validation**: [Required QA checks before release]  
**Deployment Plan**: [Controlled deployment approach and environment sequence]  
**Rollback Plan**: [How this change is reversed, mitigated, or contained]  
**Production Validation**: [Operational checks after deployment]

## Risky Assumptions and Open Questions

- [Assumption or open question with potential delivery impact]
- [Assumption or open question with security / data / operational impact]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Non-approved integration pattern] | [current need] | [why approved pattern is insufficient] |
| [e.g., Direct schema workaround] | [specific problem] | [why standard schema approach is insufficient] |
